This program reads from a CSV file line by line and converts each row to JSON and writes to an outfile.

The following results are generated using the JSON file:

1. least and best performing restaurants and cuisines :

    APIs:
    
    - restaurant/all(GET):  Shows all restaurants along with the number of orders made from them.
    
    - restaurant/top/{num}(GET): Show top num restaurants based on the number of orders made from them. Negative num would give least popular restaurants based on number of orders.
    
    - cuisine/all(GET): Shows all cuisnes along with the number of orders made for them.
    - cuisine/top/{num}(GET): Show top num cuisnes based on the number of orders made for them. Negative num would give least popular cuisines based on number of orders.
    
    
2. Target demographic of customers according to specific cuisine :

    APIs:
    
    - state/all(GET): Shows cuisine wise number of orders for each state.
